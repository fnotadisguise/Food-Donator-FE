# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

"Food Donation Locator" App:
The "Food Donation Locator" app could be a separate React app that helps users to find local food banks or food pantries that accept donations. It would allow restaurants, individuals, and other organizations to easily locate and donate surplus food to the nearest food bank or pantry.

The app could have the following features:

User registration and login system: Users would be able to create an account and log in to the app. This would allow the app to track their donations and provide personalized recommendations.
Donation tracking: Users could input details of their donations, including the type of food donated, the date and time of the donation, and the location of the food bank or pantry. The app would automatically generate a donation receipt for tax purposes.
Donation locator: The app would use geolocation technology to help users find the nearest food banks or pantries that accept donations. Users could search by zip code, city, or state to find the most convenient locations.
Donation notifications: The app could send notifications to users when a local food bank or pantry is in urgent need of specific types of food donations, such as fresh produce or non-perishable goods.
Donation history: The app would maintain a record of users' donation history, including the quantity and type of food donated, and the location of the food bank or pantry.
The "Food Donation Locator" app could be a valuable tool for anyone looking to donate surplus food to those in need. By making it easy to locate and donate to local food banks and pantries, you can ensure that the donations are being distributed effectively and reaching those who need them the most. Additionally, by tracking users' donation history, you can encourage regular donations and create a sense of community around your food app.
